Integrity Hash is a secure, user-friendly Java Swing desktop client for managing and visualizing file-integrity scans. It connects locally to the File-Integrity Scanner backend to monitor scans, verify file hashes, and review historical results — all without external network dependencies.






## What is the File-Integrity Scanner Frontend?

The Swing-based frontend is a **desktop companion application** that allows users to interact with the File-Integrity Scanner backend in real time. It simplifies complex operations such as initiating scans, verifying file hashes, and viewing scan history, all through a clean, responsive, and local user interface.

## Key Features

- **Verify integrity of your files:**  
    Monitor file integrity status, view scan results and detect anomalies.

- **Detailed File View & History:**  
    Inspect metadata, compare hash snapshots, and review scan timelines with timestamps.

- **Hash Algorithm Visualization:**  
    Supports displaying results for SHA-256, SHA-3 (256-bit), and BLAKE2b (512-bit).

- **Secure Local Operation:**  
    All operations and communications occur locally — **no external network services or cloud dependencies**.

    Built with pure Java Swing for performance and reliability — platform‑independent across Windows, macOS, and Linux.
## Requirements

- **Java 21+**
